# Abstract-Data-Art
This is my Unit 4 Final Project
# Unit 4 - Abstract Art Project

## Introduction

Data visualizations are powerful tools to present information and convey patterns and relationships. Sometimes visualizations are charts or graphs, and other times they are more abstract pieces of art. Your goal is to create a visual representation relating at least two categories from your dataset that engages your viewer and encourages them to learn more about your chosen topic.

## Requirements

Use your knowledge of object-oriented programming, one-dimensional (1D) arrays, and algorithms to create your data visualization program:

- **Create at least two 1D arrays** – Create at least two 1D arrays to store the data that will make up your visualization.
- **Implement one or more algorithms** – Implement one or more algorithms that use two-way or multi-selection statements with compound Boolean expressions to analyze the data.
- **Use methods in the Math class** – Use one or more methods in the Math class in your program, such as to perform calculations on the values in your dataset and display the results, choose random values from the dataset, or display images or shapes at random locations.
- **Create a visualization** – Create an image or animation that conveys the story of the data by illustrating the patterns or relationships in the data.
  Note: This may be abstract! Others do not necessarily need to know what the story or pattern is right away, but you do need to be able to explain it to them.
- **Document your code** – Use comments to explain the purpose of the methods and code segments and note any preconditions and postconditions.

## Dataset

Include a hyperlink to the source of your dataset used for this project. Additionally, provide a short description of each column used from the dataset, and the data type.


Dataset: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HrDwFNM6Gf9RlbUH9HGGvHgSBpkOhtQS_EdkHwpAQvY/edit?gid=1638692842#gid=1638692842

- **Name** (String) - name of dog
- **Breed Group** (String) - type of breed  group
- **Minimum Life Span** (int) - min life
- **Maximum Life Span** (int) - max life
- **Maximum Height** (int) - max height
- **Maximum Weight** (int) - max weight

## Description

Write a description of your project here. In your description, include as many vocab words from our class to explain your User Story, the chosen dataset and how your project addressed that users goals. If your project used the Scanner class for user input, explain how the user will interact with your project.

My project is a rolling app that allows the user to recieve various information accounts about dogs. My program uses a Scanner class to recieve input from the user differentiating the use of certain methods. The user can choose to roll a random dog in general, or a random dog from either small or big  categories, categorized as big and small based on their maximum weight. This project addresses people who want information about dogs.
